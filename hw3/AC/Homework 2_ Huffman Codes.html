    <dd><code>Makefile</code> and all the necessary C++ source files. Do NOT check in object (<code>*.o</code>) or executable (<code>huffman</code>) files. When I type the command <code>make</code> with no argument, your <code>Makefile</code> should create an executable named <code>huffman</code>. Your program should compile on Linux and behave the same as my reference program. Check in your code with the appropriate <code>git</code> commands.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, the Mamerican forces 
<del>invaded</del> liberated Mafghanistan in pursuit of <del><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/world/asia/14minerals.html">mineral</a></del> freedom.  However, terrorist attacks spread across Mafghanistan like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill">the oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon</a>.  You, as the Commanding General of the Mamerican forces and their Mafghan <del>puppets</del> allies, just discovered  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844/">the book</a>,
 which describes efficient algorithms for terminating insurgents, that 
would ensure victory in Mafghanistan.  You wish to send this book to all
 the troops via the Internet.  However, due to the <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">astronomical debt</a> of the Mamerican government, you wish to compress the book to reduce your ISP charges.</p>

<p>Use Huffman codes for compression/decompression.</p>
<ul>
<li>The input to compression is a sequence of 8-bit characters.</li>
<li>When computing the Huffman tree, do not compute the code for any character that is absent from the input.  Do not insert these characters into the min-heap.</li>
<li>To ensure consistent behavior between your program and mine, during the <code>delete</code> operation on the min-heap, you need to determine the priority of the subtrees that have the same weight.  Let <code>S</code> and <code>T</code> be two subtrees.  <code>S</code> has a higher priority than <code>T</code> if and only if:
<ul>
<li><code>S</code>'s weight is smaller than <code>T</code>'s weight, or</li>
<li><code>S</code> and <code>T</code> have the same weight, and the smallest character (in ASCII value) in any of <code>S</code>'s leaves is smaller than that in any of <code>T</code>'s leaves.
</li>
</ul>
Under this definition, the <code>delete</code> operation should remove the subtree with the highest priority from the min-heap.  Also when merging two subtrees, set the tree with the lower priority as the left subtree (whose code is <code>0</code>), and the tree with the higher priority as the right subtree (whose code is <code>1</code>).
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may NOT use STL classes except the <code>string</code> class.</p>
<p><b>Command line:</b>  Your program accepts an optional command line argument "<code>-d</code>":</p>
<ul>
<li>When this argument is absent, compress the input and writes the compressed data to the output.</li>
<li>When this argument is present, decompress the input and writes the decompressed data to the output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read input from <code>cin</code> and write output to <code>cout</code>.</p>
<p><b>Uncompressed data:</b> The uncompressed data contains  a sequence of 8-bit characters.  The input contains at most 2<small><sup>32</sup></small>-1 characters.
</p>
<p><b>Compressed data:</b> The compressed data contains three sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>Magic cookie. This section contains 8 characters: the string "HUFFMAN" followed by the ASCII 0 character ('<code>\0</code>').  
</li>
<li>Frequencies.  This section contains the frequencies of all the characters from ASCII 0 to ASCII 255, even if a characer is absent from the uncompressed data.  The frequency of a character is its count in the uncompressed data.  Order the frequencies by the ASCII values of their corresponding characters.  Write each frequency as a 4-byte unsigned integer in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little-endian</a> form.</li>
<li>Compressed data.  This section contains the codes of all the characters in the same order as they appear in the uncompressed data.  Since this section contains a sequence of bits but the smallest unit of data is a byte in files, you need to convert bits into bytes by the following rules:
<ul>
<li>Starting from the beginning of the bit sequence, convert each sequence of 8 consecutive bits into 1 byte.  If the number of bits is not a multiple of 8, pad the end of the bit sequence with 0s.</li>
<li>When converting 8 bits into 1 byte, let the first bit be the least significant bit (LSB) in the byte, the second bit be the second LSB, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We will test the decompression function of your program with only valid compressed data, so your program need not handle errors in the compressed data.</p>

<p><b>Extras</b></p>
<ul>
<li>My reference program has a verbose mode, which during compression prints all the codes for debugging purposes.  Use the "-v" option to invoke this mode.  You do not need to implement this mode.</li>
<li>The compression function in my reference program scans the input twice.  During the first pass, it computes the frequency of each ASCII character.  During the second pass, it encodes each character in the input.  The function calls <code>istream::seekg()</code> between the two passes.   Since a pipe is unseekable, you cannot pass a UNIX pipe as the input to my program (e.g., "<code>cat input | huffman</code>" would not work).  Instead, you must use input redirection, such as "<code>huffman &lt; input</code>".</li>
<li>Food for thought (you need not submit the answer to this questions):
  <ul>
    <li>How do you compare your program to other Unix compressors, such as gzip/gunzip?</li>
    <li>Can the <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">national debt</a>
 of the Mamerican government be represented in a signed 32-bit integer, 
unsigned 32-bit integer, or signed 64-bit integer?  What's the running 
      time of the fastest algorithm for avoiding the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/">Judgment Day</a> of national debt?</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Trivia: 
For the etymology of the names in this story, watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1291171/">2007 Mypods and Boomsticks</a>.</li>
</ul>
